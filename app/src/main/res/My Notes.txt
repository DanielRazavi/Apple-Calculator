The numbers are going to be built into the 
system and their respective functionalities.

The operations are going to be objects of 
some sort where they are called once they're
clicked. 

So far I don't know if there should be an
implementation or extension to start it, but
I do know that almost all operations are
either two parameters or one, and they do 
return something.

So I'm thinking an interface that you give
the parameters to and it returns the needed
integer.

Just learned what Shunting-Yard algorithm is
and what a Reverse Polish Notation is. Very
helpful.

Where should I apply the Stack and Queue?
Would it be in onCreate? Probably, and then
calling different metods of those
datastructures in each button's case in
onClick.
